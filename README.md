BlueChecker will help you audit PowerShell and check for any suspicious activity.

Simply download the script or run remotely using:

powershell –nop –c “iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securethelogs/Bluechecker/master/Bluechecker.ps1’)”

Once ran, BlueChecker will check for:

- Powershell status
- Evidence of downgrading
- Registry and GP set for PowerShell auditing
- Malicious scripts using keywords
- Event logs for Module logging and script block logging.
